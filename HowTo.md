## How to use:

initially you will be welcomed by the login screen which is homepage. You can choose to login if you already have registered. But if you are an Admin your login details are set to:

username: Admin01 , password: Admin1234 (Which can be changed)

##### Employee:

Once registered you can access the Employee dashboard.

You have login details on the top left and a sign out button on the top right. You also have access to add new clocking times on the right hand side. Which then allows you see what you have added on the left hand side as a list.

To access your details or to edit your details you can access that by clicking on your name on the top left hand side of the screen. You can also change you password there too.

Originally the data is not editable but if you press the edit toggle up on top you will be given access to edit your details including your password. Everything in the grey box is not editable as it is either set by your employer or by you during registrations.
