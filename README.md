# WPF-EF_Project

### Project Description

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The main purpose of this project is to work as a clock in/out an application where the "Employee" can create an "Account". This is then approved by the Admin. The employee is able to access the application after being confirmed. And can clock in and out of their application. Hours are calculated and is then displayed for them to view. Employee details are visible to both Admin and Employee.



#### Project Goals

---------------------------------------------------

The project will be a 3 tier application consisting of:

* Model(Database)
* Business Logic(Code that interacts with your database and GUI)
* GUI(Graphical User Interface)

The MVP goals of the project are to successfully show both employer and employees their correct data. For example, if an employer wants to see how many hours an employee has done they can do so along with their pay. And the same goes for the employee which can also view their hours, pay and personal information.



Goals for expansion of some features are such:

* Requesting holidays
* Employer able to modify or remove an employee
* Employer able to request for shifts.

#### Sprint Review

In this second sprint I was able to finish all the tasks set out for the development of the Login window mainly the GUI and the business logic code which allows the employee to access the dashboard.  So now the employee can access the dashboard by either creating an account or login in directly if they already have an account. Once completed the sprint for today I focused on getting the readme document up to date and working on designs for the next sprint which is going to require more time do develop. 

##### Project Retrospective

I managed to work quickly on this sprint but I did run into a few issues that could have been avoided I had taken a bit more time to think about the possible use case of certain database fields. As a result I had to drop my tables as I noticed that by making my database primary keys auto increment I am unable to set them manually.  After that I was able recreate the tables and scaffold the database. 

I noticed that I had underestimated this sprint as I managed to finish it ahead of our evening reviews. I need to take into consideration on how long a feature may take and plan properly. Based on todays situation I can predict that I will be doing more than today in tomorrows sprint.
